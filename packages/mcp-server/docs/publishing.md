# Publishing

The canonical source and release authority is
`https://github.com/oaslananka/kicad-studio-kit`.

All CI/CD, release, registry, package-manager, signing, provenance, and
attestation workflows are owned by that canonical repository.

## PyPI

Python package releases use `.github/workflows/release-please.yml` in
`oaslananka/kicad-studio-kit`. The workflow builds the Python distributions,
creates release artifacts, generates SBOM and checksum files, signs artifacts
with Sigstore, creates GitHub artifact attestations, and publishes to PyPI only
when release-please reports that a release was created and the protected
`release` environment is approved.

The release workflow uses PyPI Trusted Publishing through GitHub Actions OIDC.
Long-lived package-index token secrets should not be needed once the PyPI
trusted publisher is configured.

## GitHub Releases

GitHub Release artifacts are produced by `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`.
Expected release assets include:

- Python wheel and source distribution under `dist/`
- `SHA256SUMS.txt` from the `python-release-evidence` workflow artifact
- `bom.json` SBOM
- Sigstore signing artifacts
- GitHub artifact attestations attached to the release workflow run

Verification guidance lives in
[Release Integrity](security/release-integrity.md).

## GHCR Container Image

Container image publishing is handled by
`.github/workflows/publish-mcp-container.yml` in the canonical repository. The
image name is:

```text
ghcr.io/oaslananka/kicad-mcp-pro
```

The Docker workflow validates the image on pull requests, publishes only for
MCP server release tags such as `mcp-server-v1.1.0`, and pushes multi-arch
`linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` images to GHCR. Stable releases also update
`ghcr.io/oaslananka/kicad-mcp-pro:latest`; production deployments should use
the release version tag or immutable GHCR digest.

The publish job signs the pushed image digest with Sigstore `cosign`, requests
BuildKit provenance, attaches a BuildKit SBOM, and runs Trivy against the image
digest before signing.

Run the default streamable HTTP image:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:3334:3334 \
  -e KICAD_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN="replace-with-strong-32-character-token" \
  ghcr.io/oaslananka/kicad-mcp-pro:<version>
```

Use stdio explicitly for stdio-only MCP clients:

```bash
docker run --rm -i ghcr.io/oaslananka/kicad-mcp-pro:<version> --transport stdio
```

DockerHub publishing is not enabled. The configured DockerHub secrets are
reserved for a future explicitly gated workflow.

## MCP Registry

`server.json` is the official MCP registry manifest because the current MCP
registry documentation points publishers at the `server.json` schema hosted by
Model Context Protocol. `mcp.json` is kept as a compatibility manifest for
clients and registries that still expect the older repository-root metadata
shape.

Both files must remain synchronized with:

- `pyproject.toml` project name and version
- Canonical repository URL
- CLI command `kicad-mcp-pro`
- PyPI package metadata
- GHCR image metadata

Validation commands:

```bash
uv run python scripts/sync_mcp_metadata.py --check
uv run python scripts/validate_mcp_manifest.py
```

Publishing is handled by `.github/workflows/publish-mcp-registry.yml`. The
workflow validates metadata and runs the registry adapter in dry-run mode on
pull requests that touch the MCP server, npm wrapper, or registry workflow
configuration. Real publishing runs only for published GitHub Releases or a
manual workflow dispatch with `dry_run=false`, and uses the protected
`mcp-registry` environment.

If an official target is selected, the workflow uses `mcp-publisher` with
GitHub OIDC. No long-lived token is required for the official target. If a
generic or third-party target is selected without a configured URL, the adapter
fails fast instead of pretending to publish.

## Homebrew

Homebrew tap updates are scaffolded by `.github/workflows/homebrew-publish.yml`
after a GitHub Release is published.

- The workflow creates a pull request against `oaslananka/homebrew-tap`.
- The workflow uses `PACKAGE_MANAGER_TOKEN`.
- The workflow does not push directly to the tap `main` branch.

The formula installs from the PyPI source distribution using Homebrew's Python
virtualenv helper and generated Python resources.

## Scoop

Scoop bucket updates are scaffolded by `.github/workflows/scoop-publish.yml`
after a GitHub Release is published.

- The workflow creates a pull request against `oaslananka/scoop-bucket`.
- The workflow uses `PACKAGE_MANAGER_TOKEN`.
- The workflow does not push directly to the bucket `main` branch.

The manifest references the PyPI wheel for version/hash metadata and installs
the Python package into the Scoop app directory at install time.

## npm Wrapper

The repository root `package.json` is private and exists only for hooks and CI
scripts. It must not be published to npm.

The optional npm wrapper lives under `packages/mcp-npm/`:

```text
packages/mcp-npm/package.json
packages/mcp-npm/bin/kicad-mcp-pro.js
```

The wrapper package name is `kicad-mcp-pro`. It does not install
Python dependencies during the package-manager install lifecycle; at runtime it
executes:

```bash
uvx kicad-mcp-pro
```

No npm publish workflow is enabled yet. npm trusted publishing is available, but
the package must be configured in npm before a guarded workflow is added.

## Required Configuration

Required GitHub environment:

- `mcp-registry`
- `ghcr`

Required GitHub secrets:

- `PACKAGE_MANAGER_TOKEN`

The npm wrapper uses trusted publishing through GitHub Actions OIDC. Do not add
an `NPM_TOKEN` secret for the canonical npm publish workflow.

Required GitHub variables:

- `MCP_REGISTRY_URL` only for generic or third-party registry adapters

## Install Examples

Linux and macOS:

```bash
uvx kicad-mcp-pro
pipx install kicad-mcp-pro
docker run --rm -i ghcr.io/oaslananka/kicad-mcp-pro:<version> --transport stdio
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
uvx kicad-mcp-pro
pipx install kicad-mcp-pro
docker run --rm -i ghcr.io/oaslananka/kicad-mcp-pro:<version> --transport stdio
```

Claude Desktop stdio example:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kicad-mcp-pro": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["kicad-mcp-pro"]
    }
  }
}
```

The CLI can also generate client snippets:

```bash
kicad-mcp-pro mcp-config generate --client claude
kicad-mcp-pro mcp-config generate --client cursor
kicad-mcp-pro mcp-config generate --client vscode
kicad-mcp-pro mcp-config generate --client codex
```

Container stdio example:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kicad-mcp-pro": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "ghcr.io/oaslananka/kicad-mcp-pro:<version>",
        "--transport",
        "stdio"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
