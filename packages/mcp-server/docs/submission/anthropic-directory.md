# Anthropic Connector Directory Submission

Use this document when submitting KiCad MCP Pro to the Anthropic Connector Directory.

## Submission URL

- Submit at `https://clau.de/mcp-directory-submission`.
- Keep a copy of the submitted field values in `PUBLIC_LISTING.md`.
- Use UTC timestamps for submitted and approved dates.
- Do not paste secret values into the submission form.

## Exact Field Values

- [ ] Server name: `KiCad MCP Pro`.
- [ ] Short description: `Local KiCad MCP server for PCB, schematic, validation, and manufacturing workflows.`
- [ ] Category: `EDA / Hardware Design`.
- [ ] Fallback category: `Developer Tools`.
- [ ] Transport: `stdio`.
- [ ] Repository URL: `https://github.com/oaslananka/kicad-studio-kit`.
- [ ] Privacy URL: `https://oaslananka.github.io/kicad-studio-kit/privacy/`.
- [ ] Support URL: `https://github.com/oaslananka/kicad-studio-kit/issues`.
- [ ] Documentation URL: `https://oaslananka.github.io/kicad-studio-kit`.
- [ ] Package install command: `uvx kicad-mcp-pro`.
- [ ] MCP server name: `io.github.oaslananka/kicad-mcp-pro`.
- [ ] License: `MIT`.

## OAuth Section

- [ ] State: `KiCad MCP Pro is a local stdio MCP server and does not require OAuth.`
- [ ] State: `The server does not host a user account system.`
- [ ] State: `The server does not request Anthropic user credentials.`
- [ ] State: `The server does not require browser redirect flows.`
- [ ] State: `HTTP mode is optional and separate from the directory review path.`
- [ ] State: `Any optional bearer token is local operator configuration, not OAuth.`
- [ ] Do not claim OAuth support in the Anthropic form.
- [ ] Do not attach OAuth screenshots.

## Safety Story

- [ ] Default reviewer path is local stdio.
- [ ] The server processes KiCad project files on the reviewer machine.
- [ ] Telemetry is disabled by default; optional OpenTelemetry export requires explicit operator configuration.
- [ ] No network egress is required for the default stdio workflow.
- [ ] KiCad CLI is the only required subprocess for default operation.
- [ ] Optional Freerouting Docker is separate and operator-enabled.
- [ ] Manufacturing package export is gated by `project_quality_gate`.
- [ ] Read-only tools are annotated as read-only in metadata.
- [ ] Destructive tools are marked with destructive metadata.
- [ ] Open-world behavior is surfaced through tool annotations.
- [ ] Filesystem scope is constrained by project directory and workspace root.
- [ ] Diagnostics report token presence only, not token values.

## Reviewer Test Plan

- [ ] Fixture path: `tests/fixtures/benchmark_projects/pass_sensor_node/`.
- [ ] Fixture project: `tests/fixtures/benchmark_projects/pass_sensor_node/demo.kicad_pro`.
- [ ] Prompt 1: `Call kicad-mcp-pro's health check and tell me which subsystems are ready.`
- [ ] Prompt 1 expected tool call: `kicad_get_version`.
- [ ] Prompt 1 expected result: version and KiCad CLI status are reported.
- [ ] Prompt 2: `Set the project to the pass_sensor_node fixture and run project_quality_gate.`
- [ ] Prompt 2 expected tool calls: `kicad_set_project`, `project_quality_gate`.
- [ ] Prompt 2 expected result: gate summary and fix queue are visible.
- [ ] Prompt 3: `Inspect schematic connectivity for the pass_sensor_node fixture without editing files.`
- [ ] Prompt 3 expected tool call: `schematic_connectivity_gate`.
- [ ] Prompt 3 expected result: connectivity status is returned without file edits.

## Example Reviewer Prompts

- [ ] Example prompt A: `Use KiCad MCP Pro to verify the fixture project health and summarize ready subsystems.`
- [ ] Example prompt B: `Run the project quality gate on tests/fixtures/benchmark_projects/pass_sensor_node/demo.kicad_pro and explain any blockers.`
- [ ] Example prompt C: `Attempt a manufacturing package export and explain why it is allowed or blocked by the gate.`
- [ ] For every prompt, instruct the reviewer to use the committed fixture, not a private board.
- [ ] For every prompt, explain that wrong absolute paths are client configuration failures.

## Expected Timeline

- [ ] Set expectation to approximately two weeks for initial review.
- [ ] Do not promise a fixed Anthropic approval date.
- [ ] Check email and GitHub issues daily during the review period.
- [ ] If rejected, copy only actionable technical requirements into a public issue.
- [ ] If approved, update `PUBLIC_LISTING.md` with the public listing URL.
