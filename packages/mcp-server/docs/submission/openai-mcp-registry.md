# OpenAI MCP Registry Submission

This document covers the registry publish path driven by `server.json`.

## Source of Truth

- Use `server.json` as the single source of truth for registry metadata.
- Do not hand-edit registry payloads after generation.
- Keep `mcp.json` synchronized with `server.json` and `pyproject.toml`.
- Version must match `src/kicad_mcp/__init__.py`.

## Verified Registry Status (2026-05-31)

Verification of the official MCP Registry (`registry.modelcontextprotocol.io`) for
`io.github.oaslananka/kicad-mcp-pro`, per issue #272. No publish was performed and no
version, tag, or release identity was changed.

| Field            | Official registry record                              | Canonical repo (`server.json`)                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Listing status   | `active`, `isLatest: true`                            | n/a                                              |
| Published (UTC)  | `2026-04-15T21:15:40Z`                                | n/a                                              |
| Version          | `2.1.0`                                               | `3.6.0`                                          |
| Packages         | `pypi` only                                           | `pypi`, `npm`, `oci`                             |
| `repository.url` | legacy standalone `kicad-mcp-pro` repo (pre-monorepo) | `https://github.com/oaslananka/kicad-studio-kit` |

Findings:

- The server **is** listed and active in the official registry, so the historical
  "Not submitted" entry in `PUBLIC_LISTING.md` was inaccurate and has been corrected.
- The listing is **stale**: the registry shows `2.1.0` while the current product line is
  `3.6.0` (PyPI already has `3.6.0`). The record predates the monorepo migration, so its
  `repository.url` still points at the legacy standalone repository and it advertises only
  the PyPI package.
- `server.json` and `mcp.json` both validate against the official
  `2025-12-11` `server.schema.json`, and `metadata:check` / `submission:check` pass, so the
  current manifest is publish-ready.

Verification commands:

```bash
# Listing status + version in the official registry
curl -fsS "https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0/servers?search=kicad-mcp-pro"

# Local manifest validity + publish payload (target/endpoint, no publish)
corepack pnpm --dir packages/mcp-server run mcp:manifest:check
corepack pnpm --dir packages/mcp-server run publish:mcp:dry-run
```

### Endpoint and Workflow Verification

- `publish_mcp_registry.py` defaults `MCP_REGISTRY_TARGET=official`; with no
  `MCP_REGISTRY_URL` override it delegates to the pinned `mcp-publisher` CLI, which targets
  the official registry (`registry.modelcontextprotocol.io`) by default. Endpoint confirmed
  correct.
- `.github/workflows/publish-mcp-registry.yml` `publish` job runs `mcp-publisher login github-oidc`
  then `mcp-publisher publish` from `packages/mcp-server`, gated to
  `release: published` or `workflow_dispatch` with `dry_run=false`.

### Update Path (to refresh the listing to the current version)

No stored registry API token is required — the official target authenticates via GitHub
OIDC under the `oaslananka` namespace (`id-token: write`).

1. Confirm PyPI/GHCR artifacts exist for the target version (PyPI `3.6.0` already published).
2. Trigger the publish job via a GitHub `release: published` event, or manually via
   `workflow_dispatch` with `dry_run=false`.
3. Approve the `mcp-registry` GitHub Environment when prompted (manual environment gate).
4. Re-run the `search` command above and confirm `version` and `repository.url` updated.

## Dry Run Flow

- [ ] Run `pnpm run submission:check` first.
- [ ] Run `uv run --all-extras python scripts/publish_mcp_registry.py --dry-run`.
- [ ] Inspect the dry-run payload for repository URL correctness.
- [ ] Inspect the dry-run payload for privacy URL correctness.
- [ ] Inspect the dry-run payload for package identifiers.
- [ ] Inspect the dry-run payload for transport type `stdio`.
- [ ] Stop if dry-run output contains old owner strings.
- [ ] Stop if dry-run output contains a container image outside GHCR canonical namespace.

## Live Publish Flow

- [ ] Run live publish only after dry-run output is reviewed.
- [ ] Use the maintainer account controlled by Osman Aslan.
- [ ] Record live publish UTC timestamp in `PUBLIC_LISTING.md`.
- [ ] Record registry response URL in `PUBLIC_LISTING.md` only after it is public.
- [ ] Do not publish from a dirty working tree.
- [ ] Do not publish with placeholder screenshots if the registry requires production media.

## PyPI Trusted Publisher OIDC

- [ ] Confirm PyPI project name is `kicad-mcp-pro`.
- [ ] Confirm workflow is `release-please.yml`.
- [ ] Confirm release environment is `release`.
- [ ] Confirm owner is `oaslananka`.
- [ ] Confirm repository is `kicad-studio-kit`.
- [ ] Confirm OIDC `id-token: write` remains configured for release publish.
- [ ] Remove token-based PyPI secrets after Trusted Publishing is active.
- [ ] Do not paste PyPI credentials into registry forms or docs.

## Container Image Verification

- [ ] Image pattern: `ghcr.io/oaslananka/kicad-mcp-pro:<version>`.
- [ ] Use the version from `pyproject.toml`.
- [ ] Verify digest before announcing a release.
- [ ] Verify provenance before announcing a release.
- [ ] Do not publish DockerHub coordinates because DockerHub is not enabled.
- [ ] Do not publish old GHCR namespace coordinates.

## Cosign Verification Snippet

```bash
VERSION=$(python -c "import tomllib; print(tomllib.load(open('pyproject.toml', 'rb'))['project']['version'])")
cosign verify ghcr.io/oaslananka/kicad-mcp-pro:${VERSION} \
  --certificate-identity-regexp "https://github.com/oaslananka/kicad-studio-kit/.github/workflows/publish-mcp-container.yml@refs/tags/mcp-server-v.*" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
```

## Registry Metadata Checks

- [ ] Check `server.json` schema before publish.
- [ ] Check package registry entry `kicad-mcp-pro` before publish.
- [ ] Check OCI package identifier before publish.
- [ ] Check website URL before publish.
- [ ] Check license value `MIT` before publish.
- [ ] Check capabilities include tools.
- [ ] Check capabilities include resources.
- [ ] Check capabilities include prompts.

## Failure Handling

- [ ] If schema validation fails, fix `server.json` and rerun `metadata:check`.
- [ ] If PyPI version is missing, stop until release publication completes.
- [ ] If GHCR image is missing, stop until container publication completes.
- [ ] If cosign verification fails, treat release as blocked.
- [ ] If registry rejects metadata, open a GitHub issue with the exact rejected field.
- [ ] If network is offline, treat PyPI reachability as warning-only in local checks.
