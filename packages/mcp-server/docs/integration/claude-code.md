# Claude Code

The simplest Claude Code setup uses `stdio`. For longer-lived multi-client setups, prefer streamable HTTP.

KiCad MCP Pro 1.0.0 and newer defer heavy tool registration in `stdio` mode so Claude
Code can send `initialize` immediately after spawning the server. If Claude Code reports
`Failed to reconnect to kicad`, upgrade the package first:

```bash
pipx upgrade kicad-mcp-pro
# or, for uv tool installs:
uv tool upgrade kicad-mcp-pro
```

## Recommendation

- Local single-user session: `stdio`
- VS Code webview or KiCad Studio bridge: `http`
- If you need local auth, set `KICAD_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`
