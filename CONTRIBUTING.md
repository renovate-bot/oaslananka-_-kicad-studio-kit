For extension-only work:

corepack pnpm run test:kicad-studio
corepack pnpm run build:kicad-studio
corepack pnpm run package:kicad-studio
```

For MCP server work:

```bash
uv sync --all-extras --frozen --project packages/mcp-server
corepack pnpm run check:kicad-mcp-pro
corepack pnpm run test:kicad-mcp-pro
corepack pnpm run build:kicad-mcp-pro
corepack pnpm run package:kicad-mcp-pro
```

For protocol or integration work:

```bash
corepack pnpm run test:contract
corepack pnpm run test:fixtures
```

Report KiCad, VS Code, MCP protocol, dependency, or release-tool compatibility failures with the compatibility regression issue form. Include old and new versions, the failing command or workflow, and any canary run link.

## Issue order

Work should follow the governance phases in [docs/architecture/governance-board.md](docs/architecture/governance-board.md):

1. Monorepo foundation and product boundaries.
2. Shared tests, fixtures, schemas, and contract infrastructure.
3. MCP compatibility foundation.
4. UI/UX and known product bugs.
5. Release, dependency, and supply-chain hardening.

Keep PRs single-purpose. Do not mix folder moves, CI rewrites, UI bug fixes, and release changes in one branch.

## Regression coverage

Bug fixes require automated regression coverage when practical. Use unit tests, integration tests, fixture checks, contract tests, or visual/a11y checks depending on the changed surface. If automation is not practical, state the reason and include the manual verification command or artifact in the PR notes.
