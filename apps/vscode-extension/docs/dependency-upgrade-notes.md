# Dependency Maintenance Notes

This monorepo uses Renovate as the dependency maintenance bot. Repository-local Renovate configuration was removed so GitHub does not open duplicate dependency pull requests against the same package and workflow surfaces.

## Current Cleanup

- Renovate covers npm, GitHub Actions, Dockerfile, and PEP 621 Python dependencies.
- Renovate lock-file maintenance refreshes `pnpm-lock.yaml` on the weekly maintenance window. (Python MCP server lock files are managed in [oaslananka/kicad-mcp](https://github.com/oaslananka/kicad-mcp).)
- GitHub Action references remain pinned to immutable commit SHAs.
- `@types/node` stays below `25` while the workspace runtime is Node 24.
- `@types/vscode` stays aligned with `engines.vscode: ^1.101.0`.
- Python dependency updates are applied through `pyproject.toml` plus `uv.lock`.

| `ovsx`                             | `0.10.12` |
| `actionlint`                       | `2.0.6`   |
| `authlib`                          | `1.7.2`   |
| `diff` (pnpm override)             | `9.0.0`   |
| `eslint`                           | `10.4.1`  |
| `@eslint/js`                       | `10.0.1`  |
| `@vscode/test-electron`            | `3.0.0`   |
| `ovsx`                             | `1.0.1`   |

`diff` is a transitive dev/build-tooling dependency (consumed by `mocha`,
`release-please`, and `code-suggester`); the repo pins a single resolved version through
the `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `overrides` block. The override was raised from `8.0.4` to the
`9.0.0` major. The consuming tools still declare sub-`9` ranges (`mocha` `^7.0.0`,
`release-please`/`code-suggester` `^8.0.3`), so the override forces the major onto them;
this matches the existing pattern (the `8.0.4` override already exceeded `mocha`'s
`^7.0.0`). `diff` 9 drops ES5 support (fine for the Node 24 runtime) and changes
`parsePatch`/`formatPatch` behavior; the full lint, typecheck, test, build, and
`release-please` dry-run suites pass with `9.0.0`.

`eslint` and `@eslint/js` were raised from `9.39.4` to the `10` major. The extension
already uses flat config (`eslint.config.cjs`), so no config-format migration was needed;
`@typescript-eslint` `8.59.2` already declares `eslint` `^10.0.0` as a supported peer. Two
adjustments were required: the `lint` script dropped the removed `--ext` flag
(`eslint src test scripts`; flat config drives extension matching via its `files`
patterns), and three findings from rules newly enabled in ESLint 10's `recommended` set
were fixed (`no-useless-assignment` in `scripts/check-review-threads.mjs`, and
`preserve-caught-error` in `scripts/create-release-assets.js` and `src/library/pcmService.ts`,
now chaining the caught error via `{ cause }`). Lint, format check, typecheck, the unit
suite (638 tests), and the production build all pass on `10.4.1`.

`semver` was raised from `7.8.0` to `7.8.1`. It is a runtime `dependency` consumed by
`src/mcp/compat.ts` (`coerce`/`satisfies` against the kicad-mcp-pro compatibility ranges),
so Renovate gates it behind dashboard approval as a `risk:high` protocol-surface package.
`7.8.1` is a patch release with only two bug fixes (strip build metadata before comparator
trimming; handle prerelease bounds in `subset`); neither touches the plain range checks
used here. The dedicated `mcpCompat` unit test plus the full unit suite, lint, typecheck,
and build all pass on `7.8.1`.

`@vscode/test-electron` was raised from `2.5.2` to the `3.0.0` major and `ovsx` from
`0.10.12` to the `1.0.1` major (#382). Both are dev/CI-only and ship in no artifact. The
public surface the repo uses is unchanged: `test-electron` 3.0.0 still exports the
`downloadAndUnzipVSCode(version)` overload and `runTests(options)` used in `test/runTest.ts`,
`test/e2e/vscodeHarness.ts`, and `test/runRealPairHostTest.ts` (its engine floor moved to
Node `>=22`, satisfied by the Node 24 runtime), and `ovsx` 1.0.1 keeps every flag the
publish path relies on (`publish -i/--packagePath`, `-p/--pat`, `get -v/--versionRange`,
`-o/--output`, `--metadata`), so no `publish-extension.yml` or `scripts/publish.sh` edits
were required. Typecheck, `compile-tests`, lint, the unit suite, the production build, and
VSIX packaging all pass; the real integration host is re-run by the CI matrix on every
platform.

| TypeScript 6                              | Postponed to avoid compiler and lint churn in the same release-hardening branch. `typescript-eslint` 8.59.x supports TS 6, but the repo remains on a conservative TS 5.9.x baseline for this pass.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Jest 30, `@types/jest` 30, `jest-util` 30 | Postponed until unit, integration, mocks, and extension host tests are migrated together.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Vite 8 (pnpm override)                    | Blocked by `vitepress` 1.6.4 (the newest stable VitePress; only `2.0.0-alpha` supports Vite 8). The `vite` override drives the VitePress docs build, and Vite 8 (Rolldown bundler, removed `transformWithEsbuild`) fails `vitepress build docs` against VitePress 1.6.4. Revisit once a stable VitePress releases with Vite 8 support. See [Planned Major Upgrades](#planned-major-upgrades) (#381). |
| `@types/node` 25                          | Rejected for now because the runtime target is Node 24.x.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `@types/vscode` 1.121                     | Rejected for now because the package was not published at the time; `1.120.0` was the newest registry version aligned with the previous `engines.vscode: ^1.120.0`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Planned Major Upgrades

These majors are held behind dashboard approval (`risk:high` lane in
[dependency-lifecycle.md](../../../docs/dependency-lifecycle.md)). Each entry records the
migration notes, the minimal code changes identified, the validation gate, and the
rollback path so the upgrade can be executed in a single focused PR once it is unblocked.
None of these packages ship in the VSIX, so there is no runtime impact.

### Vite 8 (#381)

- **Where it lives:** a single `vite: 6.4.3` entry in the `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
  `overrides` block. It is a transitive dependency of `vitepress` 1.6.4 and only affects
  the documentation site build. No application or runtime source imports `vite`.
- **Migration notes:** Vite 8 switches the default bundler to Rolldown and removes
  `transformWithEsbuild`. `vitepress build docs` fails on Vite 8 while VitePress is pinned
  to 1.6.4; only `vitepress@2.0.0-alpha` declares Vite 8 support. The upgrade is therefore
  coupled to a stable VitePress 2.x release.
- **Minimal code changes identified:** raise the `vite` override to `8.x` and bump
  `vitepress` to the first stable 2.x. No changes are expected in `docs/.vitepress/config.mts`
  beyond any VitePress 2.x config-shape adjustments surfaced by its own migration guide.
- **Validation gate:** `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `pnpm run docs:build`,
  `pnpm run docs:lint`, `pnpm run docs:links`, `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run lint`,
  `pnpm run test`, `pnpm run build`, `pnpm run check`, and the full CI matrix.
- **Rollback path:** revert the `vite` override to `6.4.3` and `vitepress` to `1.6.4` in a
  single revert commit; the docs build is the only consumer, so no lockfile surgery beyond
  `pnpm install` is required.
- **Status:** blocked on a stable VitePress release with Vite 8 support. Hold the
  `renovate/vite-8.x` branch unapproved on the dashboard until then.

The `@vscode/test-electron` and `ovsx` majors (#382) have been applied; see the Applied
Updates note above for the verified-unchanged API/CLI surface and the validation gate.

## Security Review

The `authlib` lock entry was raised from the vulnerable `1.7.0` release to `1.7.2`, while the declared lower bound now requires the patched `>=1.7.1` series.

No package with a new postinstall requirement was added.
