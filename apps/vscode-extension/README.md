# KiCad Studio

[![Open VSX](https://img.shields.io/open-vsx/v/oaslananka/kicadstudiokit?label=Open%20VSX)](https://open-vsx.org/extension/oaslananka/kicadstudiokit)

KiCad Studio turns VS Code into a focused KiCad workspace for project navigation, schematic and PCB inspection, DRC/ERC review, manufacturing handoff, and AI-assisted MCP workflows.

Canonical repository: https://github.com/oaslananka/kicad-studio-kit/tree/main/apps/vscode-extension

- Extension ID: `oaslananka.kicadstudiokit`
- Version: `1.2.0`
- Supported MCP: `kicad-mcp-pro >=3.5.2 <4.0.0`
- Supported KiCad projects: KiCad 8.x, 9.x, and 10.x project, schematic, PCB, DRC, and jobset files

## Quick Start

1. Install **KiCad Studio** from the Visual Studio Marketplace or Open VSX.
2. Open a folder that contains a `.kicad_pro`, `.kicad_sch`, or `.kicad_pcb` file.
3. Run **KiCad: Detect kicad-cli** from the Command Palette if KiCad is not already on `PATH`.
4. Open a schematic or PCB file to use the built-in KiCad Studio viewer.
5. Run **KiCad: Run DRC** or **KiCad: Run ERC** to populate Problems, status, and validation views.
6. Optional: start `kicad-mcp-pro` and connect your AI client with the generated `.vscode/mcp.json` schema.

```powershell
corepack enable

| Workflow                  | KiCad Studio                                                                                         | Notes                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Project tree              | Native VS Code sidebar for KiCad projects, boards, schematics, jobsets, rules, and generated outputs | Designed for mixed hardware/software workspaces                           |
| Schematic and PCB viewing | Custom editors with KiCad-aware controls and CLI fallback paths                                      | Keeps source files in VS Code while preserving KiCad as the authority     |
| DRC/ERC review            | Problems integration, freshness state, quality gates, and focused validation views                   | Helps separate fresh failures from stale report files                     |
| BOM, netlist, and exports | Repeatable commands for manufacturing handoff and release review                                     | Pairs with KiCad jobsets and project-specific presets                     |
| MCP tools dashboard       | `kicad-mcp-pro` discovery, version gating, tool status, and AI workflow readiness                    | MCP-dependent commands disable themselves when the server is incompatible |
| Localization              | English and Turkish listing copy with extension string infrastructure                                | Paired with OASLANA-106 localization work                                 |

## KiCad CLI-Only Comparison

| Workflow             | KiCad CLI-only                                                     | KiCad Studio                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Open project context | Requires remembering paths, commands, and output locations         | Sidebar discovers KiCad project structure inside the active VS Code workspace |
| Inspect design state | Exports or external KiCad windows are needed for most review loops | Schematic and PCB custom editors keep review context next to source changes   |
| Run DRC/ERC          | Terminal output and report files must be correlated manually       | Problems, validation views, and quality gates show actionable diagnostics     |
| Share AI context     | Scripts must manually expose project files and tool capabilities   | MCP dashboard gates compatible `kicad-mcp-pro` tools and workspace context    |

## MCP Compatibility

KiCad Studio 1.2.0 supports `kicad-mcp-pro >=3.5.2 <4.0.0` and was tested against `3.5.2`. If a connected server reports a version outside the required range, MCP-dependent commands are disabled while KiCad-only features continue to work.
