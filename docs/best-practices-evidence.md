| Issue tracking        | Issues, release blockers, and regressions are tracked in GitHub.                           | `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`, `SUPPORT.md`, `docs/RELEASE-COORDINATION.md`, `docs/release-candidate-checklist.md`                                                                  | Document expected response timing if the badge form requires it.             |
| Build                 | The extension has reproducible local build commands.                                       | `package.json`, `apps/vscode-extension/package.json`, `docs/getting-started.md`, `docs/devcontainer.md`                                                                         | Keep `corepack pnpm --filter kicadstudiokit run check` as the product gate.  |
| Tests                 | Unit, security, accessibility, integration, fixture, and package checks exist.             | `apps/vscode-extension/test/`, `packages/test-harness/`, `packages/kicad-fixtures/`, `docs/testing-strategy.md`, `apps/vscode-extension/jest.config.js`                         | Keep test counts and strategy current after refactors.                       |
| Dynamic analysis      | Runtime security, webview, and accessibility suites exercise the extension before release. | `apps/vscode-extension/package.json` `test:dynamic-analysis`, `apps/vscode-extension/test/security/`, `apps/vscode-extension/test/webview/`, `apps/vscode-extension/test/a11y/` | Keep runtime assertion suites in the dynamic-analysis gate.                  |
| Coverage policy       | Extension unit coverage enforces at least 80% global statements, lines, and functions.     | `apps/vscode-extension/jest.config.js` `coverageThreshold.global.statements >= 80`, checked by `corepack pnpm run check:best-practices`                                         | Keep thresholds above the Best Practices 80% statement coverage claim.       |
| Repeatable VSIX       | Two independent VSIX package runs must produce identical normalized payload content.       | `scripts/check-repeatable-vsix.mjs`, `apps/vscode-extension/scripts/validate-vsix-metadata.js`, `corepack pnpm run check:repeatable-vsix`                                       | Keep normalized content digest stable across packaging runs.                 |
| CI                    | Pull requests and default-branch changes are validated by GitHub Actions.                  | `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`, `.github/workflows/security.yml`, `.github/workflows/vsix-build.yml`, `.github/workflows/docs.yml`                  | Activate the repository ruleset so CI gates are enforced.                    |
| Static analysis       | CodeQL, ESLint, TypeScript, actionlint, and package validation are part of the gates.      | `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`, `.github/workflows/security.yml`, `eslint.config.cjs`, `scripts/check-ci-lanes.mjs`, `apps/vscode-extension/scripts/validate-package.js`        | Resolve the Scorecard SAST alert by confirming all sampled commits run SAST. |
| Dependency management | Dependency updates and supply-chain checks are automated.                                  | `renovate.json`, `scripts/check-pnpm-supply-chain.mjs`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`                                                                                                        | Keep lockfile-only installs enforced.                                        |
| Local secret hygiene  | Repository scanning and tests cover secret leakage risks.                                  | `.github/workflows/gitleaks.yml`, `apps/vscode-extension/test/security/`, `scripts/check-pnpm-supply-chain.mjs`                                                                 | Keep GitHub alert count at zero.                                             |
| Release notes         | Releases are generated and documented.                                                     | `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`, `docs/changelog/`, `docs/release.md`, `apps/vscode-extension/CHANGELOG.md`                                                              | Call out security fixes explicitly.                                          |
| Provenance            | Release evidence includes checksums, SBOM, and attestation steps.                          | `.github/workflows/publish-extension.yml`, `apps/vscode-extension/scripts/create-release-assets.js`, `scripts/check-release-provenance.mjs`, `docs/release.md`                  | Re-check Scorecard Signed-Releases after the next attested release.          |
| Branch protection     | A strict main-branch ruleset with stable required checks is versioned in the repo.         | `.github/rulesets/main.json`, `docs/architecture/branch-protection.md`, `scripts/check-branch-protection-gates.mjs`                                                             | Apply the ruleset through GitHub settings/API.                               |
| Review process        | CODEOWNERS and PR templates exist, but recent history lacks approved reviews.              | `.github/CODEOWNERS`, `.github/pull_request_template.md`, `docs/architecture/branch-protection.md`                                                                              | Require PR review for all future human changes.                              |
| Documentation         | User, extension, integration, release, security, and architecture docs are maintained.     | `docs/`, `docs/.vitepress/config.mts`, `scripts/check-docs-site.mjs`                                                                                                            | Keep links validated by `corepack pnpm run check:docs-site`.                 |
| Accessibility         | Webview accessibility tests are present and run under the extension check.                 | `apps/vscode-extension/test/a11y/`, `docs/accessibility.md`, `scripts/dev-doctor.mjs`                                                                                           | Keep Playwright browser cache covered by `dev-doctor`.                       |
| Internationalization  | UI string parity is validated.                                                             | `apps/vscode-extension/package.nls.json`, `scripts/check-nls-parity.mjs`, `apps/vscode-extension/src/webviewI18n.ts`                                                            | Fill the corresponding badge field with NLS parity evidence.                 |

## Questionnaire fill guide

Use [Best Practices Questionnaire Fill Guide](best-practices-questionnaire.md) when updating the web form. It separates evidence-backed fields from fields that should remain Partial, Not Applicable, or unclaimed until more evidence exists.

## Local evidence gate

Repository-controlled Best Practices and Scorecard hardening anchors are
validated by:

```bash
corepack pnpm run check:best-practices
```

This keeps the README badge, VitePress entry, evidence page, digest-pinned uv
devcontainer install, Playwright browser-cache doctor check, and stable branch
ruleset contexts from drifting.

## Scorecard remediation mapping

| CII-Best-Practices  | This page plus existing policy docs                                                           | Fill the Best Practices project fields and keep the badge in README.                              |
| Signed-Releases     | `publish-extension.yml`, `create-release-assets.js`, release docs                             | Confirm that the next release exposes attestations in a detectable way.                           |
| SAST                | CodeQL workflow and security workflow                                                         | Confirm CodeQL runs on every default-branch/PR path Scorecard samples.                            |
| Pinned-Dependencies | Devcontainer pins the base image, the official uv image digest, and downloaded tool checksums | Re-run Scorecard/code scanning after the next default-branch scan to clear stale line references. |
| Maintained          | Active commits and releases                                                                   | This improves automatically as the repository ages.                                               |
| Packaging           | `publish-extension.yml`, Marketplace/Open VSX publication                                     | Keep publish workflow names and release assets obvious to automated detectors.                    |

## Ruleset verification

The versioned ruleset is `.github/rulesets/main.json`. After applying it in GitHub,
verify that it is active and that the Branch-Protection Scorecard alert has
cleared in the repository security tab.
