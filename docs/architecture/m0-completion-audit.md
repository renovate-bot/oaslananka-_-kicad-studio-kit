# M0 Completion Audit

Audit date: 2026-05-21 (Europe/Istanbul)

Scope: Linear OASLANA-90, GitHub milestone
[#1](https://github.com/oaslananka/kicad-studio-kit/milestone/1), and the
M0 Monorepo Foundation workstream.

## Conclusion

M0 is complete. The GitHub M0 milestone has zero open issues and all eight
tracked foundation issues are closed. The Linear M0 project can be marked
complete after this audit PR lands.

Release-related follow-up PRs are not M0 implementation blockers:

- [#94](https://github.com/oaslananka/kicad-studio-kit/pull/94) is the
  product-scoped release PR for the VS Code extension.
- [#95](https://github.com/oaslananka/kicad-studio-kit/pull/95) is the
  grouped product-scoped release PR for KiCad MCP Pro libraries.
- [#16](https://github.com/oaslananka/kicad-studio-kit/pull/16) is the
  superseded monolithic release PR and remains read-only until maintainers
  decide how to retire it.
