# Repository Structure

KiCad Studio Kit is one GitHub repository with one local release surface and
cross-repo compatibility coverage for the external MCP server:

| Workspace                                                                       | Product role                                        | Public surface                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `apps/vscode-extension`                                                         | KiCad Studio VS Code and Open VSX extension         | `oaslananka.kicadstudiokit`                            |
| (external — see [oaslananka/kicad-mcp](https://github.com/oaslananka/kicad-mcp)) | KiCad MCP Pro Python server and MCP Registry source | `kicad-mcp-pro` / `io.github.oaslananka/kicad-mcp-pro` |

| `packages/test-harness` | Private shared test utilities | Not published |

The folder names intentionally preserve the package roots used by the current publish workflows:

- `apps/vscode-extension` keeps VS Code extension-root semantics for VSIX packaging.

- `packages/test-harness` is private test-only infrastructure used by product
  tests and CI gates. It is never a production dependency or release surface.

Do not introduce additional canonical repositories, mirrors, or alternate release roots. Cross-product work should flow through compatibility metadata, MCP manifests, shared fixtures, and contract tests rather than direct source imports.

## Root ownership

The repository root owns orchestration only:

- workspace package manager configuration
- version and forbidden-reference preflight scripts
- release and publish workflows
- architecture, publishing, security, and integration documentation

The root package is `private: true` and is never published.

## Product ownership

Extension-only changes belong under `apps/vscode-extension` unless they update root CI, docs, or release metadata.

MCP server changes now live in [oaslananka/kicad-mcp](https://github.com/oaslananka/kicad-mcp);
this repository owns only the extension-side MCP integration contract. See
[ADR 0009](../adr/0009-split-kicad-mcp-pro-into-separate-repository.md) for the
split rationale.

## Shared work

Shared contracts are consumed from
[`@oaslananka/kicad-protocol-schemas`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oaslananka/kicad-protocol-schemas)
(published from [oaslananka/kicad-mcp](https://github.com/oaslananka/kicad-mcp)).
See the [schema release lifecycle](../protocol-schemas.md#release-lifecycle) for
the cross-repo release process and CI validation gates.
Shared test utilities live under
`packages/test-harness`. Shared packages must stay under `packages/` and must
not import from any product workspace.
