# Product Boundaries

The monorepo has three product workspaces, but the products must stay decoupled at source level.

## Allowed dependencies

| From                    | May depend on                                                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `apps/vscode-extension` | npm dependencies, VS Code APIs, KiCad CLI process calls, MCP protocol data |
| `packages/mcp-server`   | Python dependencies, KiCad Python/CLI integrations, MCP protocol data      |
| `packages/mcp-npm`      | Node standard library and the published Python package name                |
| future shared packages  | external dependencies and other shared packages only                       |

## Forbidden dependencies

- The extension must not import Python server modules such as `kicad_mcp.*`.
- The MCP server must not import VS Code extension source or npm wrapper implementation.
- The npm launcher must not import extension source or Python server source.
- No product may reach into another product with relative imports.
- `packages/*` shared packages must not depend on `apps/*`.

## Integration rule

The products integrate through MCP protocol and metadata:

- `compatibility.yaml`
- `apps/vscode-extension/src/mcp/compatibilityMatrix.ts`
- `packages/mcp-server/src/kicad_mcp/compatibility.py`
- `packages/mcp-server/mcp.json`
- `packages/mcp-server/server.json`
- contract and compatibility checks

Protocol changes must update both product surfaces and the compatibility validation scripts.

## Enforcement

Run the boundary checker from the repository root:

```bash
corepack pnpm run check:boundaries
```

The checker fails when a product source file imports or path-references another product workspace implementation. CI runs the same check in the metadata job.

Ownership is declared in `.github/CODEOWNERS` for `.github/`, architecture docs, examples, the extension, the MCP server, and the npm wrapper. Branch protection guidance is documented in [branch-protection.md](branch-protection.md).
