# Architecture

The repository is split by release surface:

- `apps/vscode-extension`: VS Code and Open VSX extension root.
- (removed — MCP server source now at [KiCad MCP Pro](https://oaslananka.github.io/kicad-mcp-pro/)).

Root metadata only orchestrates workspace checks, release automation, documentation, and publish workflows.
