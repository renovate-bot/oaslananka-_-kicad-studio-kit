# Extension Troubleshooting

## KiCad CLI Not Found

Run `KiCad: Detect kicad-cli` from the command palette, or set
`kicadstudio.kicadCliPath` in the extension settings. The supported KiCad version policy is
documented in the [support matrix](../support-matrix.md).

## Workspace Trust Blocks Commands

Restricted Workspace Trust keeps read-only language and viewer features available, but disables
commands that launch local processes or write generated files. Manage trust from VS Code with
`workbench.action.manageTrust`.

## Viewer Does Not Render

Check that the workspace contains a valid `.kicad_sch` or `.kicad_pcb` file and that the file is
not empty or malformed. Viewer behavior and rendering fallback policy are covered by the generated
viewer and test strategy references:

- [Extension views](views.md)
- [Testing strategy](../testing-strategy.md)
- [Performance baselines](../performance-baselines.md)

## MCP Tools Are Disconnected

Use the MCP Tools view to inspect endpoint, transport, profile, server-info, and capability state.
The compatibility dashboard reports the MCP server name and version, endpoint and transport,
protocol and tool schema versions, KiCad CLI path and version, live GUI availability, live PCB and
schematic context, advertised tools/resources/prompts, missing required tools, missing optional
capabilities, last health check, last error, and remediation hint.

Treat a degraded dashboard state as a connected server with missing runtime guarantees. Common
degraded causes include an unavailable live PCB context, VS Code stdio transport for HTTP-only
workflows, disabled stateless Streamable HTTP, missing ChatGPT connector compatibility, or missing
extension-required tools. Use the dashboard actions to reconnect, refresh capabilities, open or save
the MCP log, pick a profile, switch endpoint, launch the local MCP server, or open compatibility
docs.

## Error Reporting

Telemetry and error reporting are opt-in and disabled by default. The policy and event classes are
documented in [telemetry and error reporting](../telemetry.md).
