# Performance Baselines

OASLANA-124 defines one performance budget catalog for KiCad Studio Kit:
[`performance/baselines.json`](../performance/baselines.json). Benchmark
producers emit measurement JSON against that catalog, then
`scripts/check-performance-budgets.mjs` reports drift and rejects performance
regressions before they merge.

## Budget Policy

The catalog uses one tolerance policy for every metric:

| Measurement result        | Checker behavior                                      |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| At or below 110% baseline | Pass.                                                 |
| Above 110% baseline       | Report a drift warning in the budget result artifact. |
| Above 120% baseline       | Fail the budget check.                                |

Measured data must name a catalog metric, keep its unit, and carry a positive
value. CI-required metrics fail closed when a producer does not emit them.

## Reference Environment

PR enforcement uses the GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-24.04` x64 runner from
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` as the reference machine. That lane reads the
repository-pinned Node version from `.node-version` and the MCP Python toolchain
selection from the [oaslananka/kicad-mcp](https://github.com/oaslananka/kicad-mcp) repository.

The catalog still records platform-specific activation budgets for Windows and
macOS/Linux because those budgets are product requirements. Cross-platform
benchmark producers added by OASLANA-46 should capture their runner identity in
their artifacts before they set another metric to `ciRequired`.

The current catalog covers these surfaces:

| Surface      | Metrics                                                                       |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Activation   | Cold Windows, cold POSIX, and warm extension activation                       |
| Project scan | Single-project, medium workspace, and large workspace scan                    |
| Viewer       | Schematic first render, PCB first render, large PCB first render, and reload  |
| Validation   | Clean DRC, medium DRC, clean ERC, and cancellation response                   |
| Export       | Export cancellation response                                                  |
| BOM/netlist  | Large schematic BOM parse and large netlist S-expression parse                |
| MCP          | `tools/list`, medium-board `pcb_get_board_summary`, and session establishment |
| Memory       | Idle extension memory and memory with a viewer open                           |

OASLANA-46 makes the POSIX activation, project scan, viewer render,
validation cancellation, BOM parse, netlist parse, export cancellation, and MCP
`tools/list` metrics CI-required. Any missing CI-required metric fails the
budget job before the pull request can merge.

## Local Checks

Validate catalog shape and checker behavior with:

```bash
corepack pnpm run check:performance-budgets
```

Run the full performance lane used by CI with:

```bash
corepack pnpm --filter kicadstudiokit run test:perf
```

Create the same extension and MCP measurements emitted by CI and evaluate
their combined budget report with:

```bash
KICAD_EXTENSION_PERFORMANCE_MEASUREMENTS_JSON=performance-results/extension-performance.json \
  corepack pnpm --filter kicadstudiokit run test:perf
node scripts/check-performance-budgets.mjs \
  --measurements performance-results/extension-performance.json \
  --output performance-results/budget-report.json
```

The benchmark producer writes sample values so reviewers can distinguish one
outlier from a repeatable shift. The budget report stores the measured value,
baseline, statistic, warning limit, failure limit, and pass/warn/fail status for
each measured metric.

## CI Evidence

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the `performance-budgets` job on every pull
request and on pushes to `main` when the performance lane is in scope. Its
reference environment is the GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-24.04` runner listed in the
catalog.

`.github/workflows/performance-nightly.yml` runs the same benchmark producer and
budget check on a nightly schedule (and on demand via `workflow_dispatch`) so a
major regression is detected even when no pull request touches the performance
lane. The nightly run uploads `performance-nightly-artifacts` for 14 days and
fails when a measured metric crosses the 20 percent failure budget.

The job uploads `performance-budget-artifacts` for 14 days:

| Artifact path                                    | Contents                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `performance-results/extension-performance.json` | Raw extension host, viewer, parser, and cancel samples. |
| `performance-results/mcp-tools-list.json`        | Raw MCP samples and the p95 measurement.                |
| `performance-results/budget-report.json`         | Budget thresholds and checker result for each metric.   |

Keep reports from the relevant PR when investigating drift. Trend dashboards
can consume the same JSON without coupling the producer to a hosted service.

## Baseline Changes

Update a baseline only with measurement evidence from the same surface and
state why the new budget is intentional in the PR. Prefer implementation fixes
when a code change crosses the 20 percent failure budget.

When a new producer becomes PR-required:

1. Add or update its metric in `performance/baselines.json`.
2. Emit the schema version, metric ID, unit, statistic, samples, and value from
   the producer.
3. Set `ciRequired` only after the PR workflow actually emits the measurement.
4. Keep the workflow artifact path stable so comparisons remain scriptable.
