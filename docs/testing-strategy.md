# Testing Strategy

OASLANA-35 / GitHub issue #36 defines the maximum automated test strategy for
KiCad Studio Kit. The goal is to make normal development depend on repeatable
local and CI gates instead of manual VS Code or KiCad inspection after every
change.

This document is the canonical repository-level testing guide. Product-specific
notes can add detail, but they should not weaken these gates.

## Gate Summary

| Gate                 | Trigger                                                              | Purpose                                                                                         | Required command                                   |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Fast PR gate         | Every pull request                                                   | Catch formatting, lint, type, unit, package, metadata, boundary, and compatibility regressions. | `corepack pnpm run check`                          |
| Performance budget   | Product, integration, and shared fixture/schema pull requests        | Report shared baseline drift and fail measured lanes that exceed the regression budget.         | `corepack pnpm run check:performance-budgets`      |
| Product gate         | Product-scoped changes                                               | Prove the touched product still builds, tests, and packages independently.                      | Product commands below                             |
| Accessibility gate   | Extension-owned UI and webview changes                               | Prove WCAG 2.1 AA automated checks remain clean for in-scope extension surfaces.                | `corepack pnpm --filter kicadstudio run test:a11y` |
| Contract gate        | Protocol, compatibility, or cross-product changes                    | Prove extension and MCP assumptions remain aligned.                                             | `corepack pnpm run test:contract`                  |
| Protocol PR gate     | Protocol, compatibility, or cross-product review changes             | Keep protocol-impact PRs visible through the PR template and architecture guidance.             | `corepack pnpm run check:protocol-pr-template`     |
| GUI smoke policy     | Real KiCad GUI smoke workflow/test wiring changes                    | Keep live-editor IPC smoke coverage wired without adding GUI work to the PR path.               | `corepack pnpm run check:kicad-gui-smoke`          |
| Fixture gate         | Parser, diagnostics, command-builder, or KiCad file behavior changes | Prove deterministic KiCad corpus behavior stays stable.                                         | `corepack pnpm run test:fixtures`                  |
| Nightly quality gate | Scheduled and manual workflow                                        | Re-run the repository gate plus contract and fixture gates outside the fast PR path.            | `.github/workflows/nightly-quality-gates.yml`      |
| KiCad GUI smoke      | Scheduled and manual workflow                                        | Launch real KiCad editors on Windows primary plus Linux Xvfb and verify MCP live PCB context.   | `.github/workflows/kicad-gui-smoke.yml`            |
| VS Code canary       | Scheduled and manual workflow                                        | Check supported VS Code host lanes before runtime/API changes reach users.                      | `.github/workflows/vscode-canary.yml`              |
| KiCad canary         | Scheduled and manual workflow                                        | Check supported KiCad CLI lanes against real fixture exports without publishing packages.       | `.github/workflows/kicad-canary.yml`               |
| Manual smoke         | Release candidate only                                               | Final human inspection where automation is not practical.                                       | PR notes must name the exact manual check          |

## Fast PR Gates

Fast gates must be deterministic and must not depend on a manually opened KiCad
or VS Code desktop session.

Run the complete repository gate before opening or updating a PR that touches
root tooling, CI, shared compatibility, release policy, or docs:

```bash
corepack enable
corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
uv sync --all-extras --frozen --project packages/mcp-server
corepack pnpm run check
```

Extension-only changes use:

```bash
corepack pnpm run check:kicad-studio
corepack pnpm run test:kicad-studio
corepack pnpm --filter kicadstudio run test:a11y
corepack pnpm run build:kicad-studio
corepack pnpm run package:kicad-studio
```

MCP server changes use:

```bash
uv sync --all-extras --frozen --project packages/mcp-server
corepack pnpm run check:kicad-mcp-pro
corepack pnpm run test:kicad-mcp-pro
corepack pnpm run build:kicad-mcp-pro
corepack pnpm run package:kicad-mcp-pro
```

npm wrapper changes use:

```bash
corepack pnpm run check:mcp-npm
```

Protocol, compatibility, or cross-product changes use:

```bash
corepack pnpm run test:contract
corepack pnpm run test:fixtures
```

## Path-Filtered CI Lanes

The fast CI workflow starts with `.github/workflows/ci.yml` job `ci-lanes`.
That job runs `node scripts/check-ci-lanes.mjs`, writes lane decisions to
`GITHUB_OUTPUT`, and writes a skip/run table to `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`.

| Lane                  | Trigger paths                                                                                                                    | CI behavior                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Metadata and policy   | Every run                                                                                                                        | Runs repository policy, ownership, version, compatibility, release-please, and governance checks. |
| VS Code extension     | `apps/vscode-extension/**`, legacy `apps/kicad-studio/**`, or root toolchain/CI changes                                          | Runs extension format, lint, typecheck, unit/a11y tests, build, package, and package validation.  |
| MCP server            | `packages/mcp-server/**`, legacy `apps/kicad-mcp-pro/**`, compatibility/release metadata, or root toolchain/CI changes           | Runs MCP metadata, format, lint, typecheck, unit tests, manifest checks, and package validation.  |
| MCP npm launcher      | `packages/mcp-npm/**`, MCP server/package metadata, shared schemas, or root toolchain/CI changes                                 | Runs npm install, pack dry-run, and launcher help smoke.                                          |
| Shared packages       | `packages/protocol-schemas/**`, `packages/kicad-fixtures/**`, `packages/test-harness/**`, or fixture corpus paths                | Runs fixture validation, compatibility matrix checks, and MCP contract validation.                |
| Integration contracts | Protocol schemas, extension MCP adapter paths, MCP runtime/capability paths, release/compatibility metadata, or workflow changes | Runs cross-product contract validation and selected real-pair compatibility tests.                |
| Performance budgets   | Extension, MCP, shared fixture/schema, or root toolchain/CI changes                                                              | Measures extension and MCP benchmark outputs and checks shared performance budgets.               |

Manual and scheduled dispatches run every lane. If the event payload cannot
provide a safe diff range, the detector falls back to running every lane rather
than accidentally skipping validation. The lane summary must show each skipped
lane and the reason it was skipped so reviewers can see when a product job was
intentionally avoided.

Validate the lane detector locally with:

```bash
corepack pnpm run check:ci-lanes
```

## Performance Budgets

`performance/baselines.json` is the shared performance budget catalog for
activation, project scan, viewer, validation, MCP, and memory regressions. The
policy and benchmark-producer contract live in
[`docs/performance-baselines.md`](performance-baselines.md).

Every full local pre-flight runs the performance catalog check through the root
gate. CI runs the `performance-budgets` job when changed paths can affect
extension, MCP, shared fixture/schema, or root toolchain behavior, and records
benchmark measurements plus the budget report as workflow artifacts. A measured
metric warns after 10 percent drift and fails after 20 percent drift. Use the
dedicated budget check while changing baseline metadata:

```bash
corepack pnpm run check:performance-budgets
```

## Nightly Quality Gates

The nightly gate catches slow and environment-sensitive regressions without
making every PR wait for the heaviest checks. It must stay non-release: no tags,
no publishing, no marketplace uploads, and no artifact promotion.

The scheduled workflow is `.github/workflows/nightly-quality-gates.yml`. It
runs on `workflow_dispatch` and a daily cron schedule. The workflow currently
executes:

```bash
corepack pnpm run check
corepack pnpm run test:contract
corepack pnpm run test:fixtures
```

The real KiCad GUI smoke suite is isolated in
`.github/workflows/kicad-gui-smoke.yml` because it starts desktop applications
and requires a display server. The workflow is scheduled and manually
dispatched only; it is not a PR or push trigger. Its Windows primary lane
installs pinned KiCad 10.0.3, adds the KiCad binary directory to discovery, and
captures process logs plus screenshots as artifacts. The Linux lane keeps a
second Xvfb/dbus signal using the repository's existing KiCad canary PPA policy.
The pytest suite is skipped unless `KICAD_MCP_ENABLE_GUI_SMOKE=1` is set, so
local and PR test runs do not try to launch a desktop session by accident.

As the M1-M4 roadmap lands, extend this workflow in focused PRs:

## KiCad Canary

`.github/workflows/kicad-canary.yml` runs real `kicad-cli` compatibility lanes
from `compatibility.yaml` every week and on manual dispatch. Required and
scheduled lanes run by default; manual dispatch can opt into deprecated lanes
that remain documented but should not block normal scheduled canaries.

Each lane writes command logs, KiCad reports, manufacturing export outputs,
`summary.json`, and `failing-fixtures.txt` into an artifact named after the
lane. Manufacturing exports are enabled only when the matrix feature gate lists
that KiCad range. Primary-lane failures fail the workflow and create or update a
compatibility issue with the `release-blocker` label; prerelease and deprecated
lanes report artifacts and issue comments without blocking the default branch.

## VS Code Canary

`.github/workflows/vscode-canary.yml` launches a focused extension host smoke
suite every week and on manual dispatch against the VS Code lanes from
`compatibility.yaml`: current stable, the minimum `engines.vscode` host, and
insiders. The smoke suite covers activation, commands, context-gated views,
custom editor/webview bootstrap, diagnostics lifecycle access, and project/MCP
view registration. Unit smokes keep the mock MCP Tools and provider paths in
the same lane. The stable and minimum lanes fail the workflow; the insiders
lane keeps reporting prerelease breakage without blocking stable support.

Each lane uploads the Extension Development Host logs and available test
artifacts. A failing lane opens or updates a compatibility issue. Stable-lane
failures add the `release-blocker` label because the release gate lists VS Code
stable compatibility as required.

## KiCad GUI Smoke

`.github/workflows/kicad-gui-smoke.yml` runs the OASLANA-44 live-editor smoke
suite daily and on manual dispatch. Windows is the primary lane because KiCad
process discovery and IPC endpoint behavior differ there; Linux Xvfb remains a
secondary lane for the repository's existing headless CI environment. The
workflow is intentionally separate from the normal nightly quality gate so GUI
failures can be triaged as environment, window-manager, or IPC regressions
without hiding deterministic unit, integration, and CLI-contract failures.

The suite launches a fixture project, opens the schematic and PCB editors where
the installed KiCad build exposes those entry points, then verifies
`pcb_get_board_summary`, `pcb_get_tracks`, `pcb_get_footprints`, and
`pcb_get_nets` report `live-gui` while the PCB Editor is open. It also verifies
the closed/unavailable GUI path reports structured file-backed fallback
diagnostics and that switching projects does not leak the old live board
context. Failures upload process stdout/stderr, tool-output JSON, discovery
metadata, and a screenshot when the runner can capture one.

## Regression Coverage Map

Every bug fix should add an automated regression when practical. If automation
is not practical, the PR must explain why and include the manual smoke command
or artifact.

## KiCad Fixture Corpus

The canonical fixture corpus for OASLANA-36 lives at
`apps/vscode-extension/test/fixtures/kicad/` and is documented in
[`docs/kicad-fixture-corpus.md`](kicad-fixture-corpus.md).

Use semantic fixture IDs from `manifest.json` rather than hard-coded directory
walks in tests. Regenerate fixtures only through the explicit generator:

```bash
corepack pnpm run fixtures:kicad:generate
```

The fixture gate is deterministic and does not invoke KiCad, VS Code, or MCP
servers implicitly:

```bash
corepack pnpm run test:fixtures
```

## CI Ownership

CI ownership follows product boundaries:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` owns path-filtered fast PR lanes for metadata,
  extension, MCP server, shared packages, integration contracts, MCP
  performance budgets, npm wrapper, and forbidden reference checks.
- `.github/workflows/security.yml`, `.github/workflows/gitleaks.yml`, and
  `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` own security and static analysis lanes.
- `.github/workflows/nightly-quality-gates.yml` owns the non-release scheduled
  quality gate.
- `.github/workflows/kicad-gui-smoke.yml` owns scheduled/manual real KiCad GUI
  live-context smoke coverage on Windows primary plus Linux Xvfb, and uploads
  debugging artifacts on failure.
- `.github/workflows/vscode-canary.yml` owns scheduled/manual VS Code
  compatibility lanes sourced from `compatibility.yaml`.
- `.github/workflows/kicad-canary.yml` owns scheduled/manual real KiCad CLI
  compatibility lanes sourced from `compatibility.yaml`.
- Product-specific validation remains inside each product package so the root
  workflow can compose it without direct source imports between products.

## Source Verification

This strategy was checked against current primary sources:

- VS Code extension testing docs for Extension Development Host and
  `@vscode/test-electron`.
- VS Code webview UX guidance for constrained webview usage and native UI
  preference.

  KiCad IPC API developer documentation for live-editor automation scope.
- KiCad Windows Downloads for supported Windows versions and current stable
  10.0.3 installer availability.
- Chocolatey KiCad package metadata for the pinned Windows CI install command
  and checksum-backed official KiCad installer URL.
- GitHub Actions artifact documentation and `actions/upload-artifact` metadata
  for scheduled failure log and screenshot uploads.
- GitHub Actions workflow syntax docs for `pull_request` path filtering,
  two-dot/three-dot diff behavior, job outputs through `GITHUB_OUTPUT`, job
  conditionals through `needs.<job>.outputs`, and `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`.
