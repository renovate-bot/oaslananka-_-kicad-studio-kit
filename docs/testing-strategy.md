# Testing Strategy

OASLANA-35 / GitHub issue #36 defines the maximum automated test strategy for
KiCad Studio Kit. The goal is to make normal development depend on repeatable
local and CI gates instead of manual VS Code or KiCad inspection after every
change.

This document is the canonical repository-level testing guide. Product-specific
notes can add detail, but they should not weaken these gates.

## Gate Summary

| Gate                 | Trigger                                                              | Purpose                                                                                                | Required command                                      |

| Product gate         | Product-scoped changes                                               | Prove the touched product still builds, tests, and packages independently.                             | Product commands below                                |
| Accessibility gate   | Extension-owned UI and webview changes                               | Prove WCAG 2.1 AA automated checks remain clean for in-scope extension surfaces.                       | `corepack pnpm --filter kicadstudiokit run test:a11y` |
| Contract gate        | Protocol, compatibility, or cross-product changes                    | Prove extension and MCP assumptions remain aligned.                                                    | `corepack pnpm run check:protocol-schemas` and `corepack pnpm run check:compatibility-contract` |
| Protocol PR gate     | Protocol, compatibility, or cross-product review changes             | Keep protocol-impact PRs visible through the PR template and architecture guidance.                    | `corepack pnpm run check:protocol-pr-template`        |
| GUI smoke policy     | Real KiCad GUI smoke workflow/test wiring changes                    | Keep live-editor IPC smoke coverage wired without adding GUI work to the PR path.                      | `corepack pnpm run check:kicad-gui-smoke`             |
| Fixture gate         | Parser, diagnostics, command-builder, or KiCad file behavior changes | Prove deterministic KiCad corpus behavior stays stable.                                                | `corepack pnpm run test:fixtures`                     |
| VS Code canary       | Scheduled and manual workflow                                        | Check supported VS Code host lanes before runtime/API changes reach users.                             | `.github/workflows/vscode-canary.yml`                 |
| Cross-repo canary    | Push, pull request, and manual workflow                              | Verify this repo consumes published `kicad-mcp` protocol schema and server artifacts.                  | `.github/workflows/cross-repo-compatibility.yml`      |
| Manual smoke         | Release candidate only                                               | Final human inspection where automation is not practical.                                              | PR notes must name the exact manual check             |

## Coverage and Mutation Thresholds

Extension unit coverage is enforced by Jest (`apps/vscode-extension/jest.config.js`)
and must not regress. The global floor is **statements 83 / branches 70 /
functions 88 / lines 83**, set just below the measured suite so new uncovered
code fails the gate rather than silently lowering the bar. Raise these floors as
coverage improves; do not lower them to make a change pass.

Branch coverage is the laggard metric: the remaining gap is concentrated in
mocking-heavy command handlers (`src/commands/*`) and the AI/LM providers
(`src/ai/*`, `src/lm/*`). Close it by exercising their error, empty, and
guard-clause paths — that is the highest-value place to add tests, not the
already-strong pure helpers.

Mutation testing is configured in `stryker.config.json` (Jest runner, `perTest`
analysis, thresholds high 80 / low 60). It currently runs with `break: 0` so it
never fails the build. The next step is to run `pnpm exec stryker run` against
the core modules, record the baseline mutation score here, and raise `break` to
that baseline so mutation coverage cannot regress.

## Fast PR Gates

Fast gates must be deterministic and must not depend on a manually opened KiCad
or VS Code desktop session.

Run the complete repository gate before opening or updating a PR that touches
root tooling, CI, shared compatibility, release policy, or docs:

```bash
corepack enable
corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
corepack pnpm run check
```

Extension-only changes use:

```bash
corepack pnpm run check:kicad-studio
corepack pnpm run test:kicad-studio
corepack pnpm --filter kicadstudiokit run test:a11y
corepack pnpm --filter kicadstudiokit run test:visual
corepack pnpm run build:kicad-studio
corepack pnpm run package:kicad-studio
```

## Visual Regression Snapshots

The extension visual gate lives in
`apps/vscode-extension/test/visual/` and uses
`apps/vscode-extension/playwright.visual.config.ts`. It covers VS Code Dark,
VS Code Light, and High Contrast themes across 1280x720, 1920x1080,
2560x1440, and 3840x2160 viewports at `deviceScaleFactor: 1` and `2`.

The committed golden set covers clean schematic, clean PCB, large schematic,
large PCB, empty project, DRC errors, ERC errors, BOM loading/success/error,
and Netlist loading/success/error fixtures. Snapshot names include the fixture
and directly preserve coverage for issues #17, #18, and #19.

Run the gate locally with:

```bash
corepack pnpm --filter kicadstudiokit run test:visual
```

```powershell
corepack pnpm --filter kicadstudiokit run test:visual
```

The diff budget is explicit: `maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.002` with Playwright
pixelmatch `threshold: 0.2`, `scale: css`, disabled animations, hidden carets,
and reduced-motion media. Golden changes must be reviewed in PRs like source
changes: the PR should explain why the UI changed, include the command above,
and avoid updating snapshots together with unrelated code.

CI visual snapshots run on the Windows extension lane with the runner Chrome
channel selected through `KICADSTUDIO_PLAYWRIGHT_CHANNEL=chrome`; local runs keep
using Playwright's bundled Chromium unless that environment variable is set.

MCP server changes are developed in the [KiCad MCP Pro](https://oaslananka.github.io/kicad-mcp-pro/) repository.

Shared test harness changes use:

```bash
corepack pnpm --dir packages/test-harness run check
corepack pnpm run check:boundaries
```

Protocol, compatibility, or cross-product changes use:

```bash
corepack pnpm run check:protocol-schemas
corepack pnpm run check:compatibility-contract
corepack pnpm run test:fixtures
```

## Bug-Fix Regression Requirement

OASLANA-61 / GitHub issue #62 makes regression coverage part of the issue
closing bar. Bug-fix pull requests must include automated regression coverage
when practical, and the evidence must be visible in the PR template before the
bug issue is closed.

Required evidence:

- A test that fails against the pre-fix behavior and passes after the fix.
- A reference to the related issue ID in the test name, test metadata, fixture
  metadata, snapshot name, or contract case.
- A fixture, golden output, visual snapshot, accessibility check, or protocol
  contract when that is the right way to reproduce the bug.
- The exact local or CI command that ran the regression.

Exceptions must explain why automation is not practical and must be approved by
a maintainer before closing the issue. Manual screenshots alone are not
sufficient for repeatable bugs; screenshots can support a visual report, but the
closing evidence should be a DOM, visual-regression, accessibility, fixture, or
integration test when the bug can be reproduced.

## Path-Filtered CI Lanes

The fast CI workflow starts with `.github/workflows/ci.yml` job `ci-lanes`.
That job runs `node scripts/check-ci-lanes.mjs`, writes lane decisions to
`GITHUB_OUTPUT`, and writes a skip/run table to `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`.

| Lane                | Trigger paths                                                                           | CI behavior                                                                                       |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Metadata and policy | Every run                                                                               | Runs repository policy, ownership, version, compatibility, release-please, and governance checks. |
| VS Code extension   | `apps/vscode-extension/**`, legacy `apps/kicad-studio/**`, or root toolchain/CI changes | Runs extension format, lint, typecheck, unit/a11y tests, build, package, and package validation.  |
| MCP server          | KiCad MCP Pro (source in separate repository)                                  | MCP tests run in the [kicad-mcp](https://oaslananka.github.io/kicad-mcp-pro/) repository.             |

| Shared packages | `packages/kicad-fixtures/**`, `packages/test-harness/**`, or fixture corpus paths | Runs fixture validation, compatibility matrix checks, and protocol schema validation. |
| Integration contracts | Protocol schemas, extension MCP adapter paths, MCP runtime/capability paths, release/compatibility metadata, or workflow changes | Runs cross-product contract validation and selected real-pair compatibility tests. |
| Performance budgets | Extension, shared fixture/schema, or root toolchain/CI changes | Measures extension benchmark outputs and checks shared performance budgets. |

Manual and scheduled dispatches run every lane. If the event payload cannot
provide a safe diff range, the detector falls back to running every lane rather
than accidentally skipping validation. The lane summary must show each skipped
lane and the reason it was skipped so reviewers can see when a product job was
intentionally avoided.

Validate the lane detector locally with:

```bash
corepack pnpm run check:ci-lanes
```

## Performance Budgets

`performance/baselines.json` is the shared performance budget catalog for
activation, project scan, viewer, validation, and memory regressions. The
policy and benchmark-producer contract live in
[`docs/performance-baselines.md`](performance-baselines.md).

Every full local pre-flight runs the performance catalog check through the root
gate. CI runs the `performance-budgets` job when changed paths can affect
extension, shared fixture/schema, or root toolchain behavior, and records
benchmark measurements plus the budget report as workflow artifacts. A measured
metric warns after 10 percent drift and fails after 20 percent drift. Use the
dedicated budget check while changing baseline metadata:

```bash
corepack pnpm run check:performance-budgets
```

## Scheduled Compatibility Gates

This repository currently keeps two scheduled or manually dispatched
compatibility workflows:

- `.github/workflows/vscode-canary.yml` checks supported VS Code host lanes.
- `.github/workflows/cross-repo-compatibility.yml` verifies published
  `@oaslananka/kicad-protocol-schemas` and `kicad-mcp-pro` artifacts without
  relying on local MCP source code.

Real KiCad CLI, GUI IPC, and MCP transport canaries run from
[KiCad MCP Pro](https://oaslananka.github.io/kicad-mcp-pro/), where the MCP
server source now lives. This repository keeps `check:kicad-gui-smoke` as a
policy check for extension wiring, not as a local GUI smoke runner.

Future local gates should land in focused PRs only when the owning workflow is
present in this repository:

| Future gate                | Tracking issue | Required behavior                                                                                                                                                            |

| Server-info contract tests | OASLANA-57     | Verify advertised server-info, capability metadata, and compatibility ranges.                                                                                                |

## KiCad Canary

Real KiCad CLI canary coverage now runs from
[KiCad MCP Pro](https://oaslananka.github.io/kicad-mcp-pro/). This repository
keeps KiCad compatibility metadata, fixture packages, and extension behavior in
sync through `check:compatibility-contract`, `check:fixtures`, and the
cross-repo compatibility workflow.

The migration checklist and IPC parity matrix live in
[`docs/compatibility/kicad-10-to-11-migration.md`](compatibility/kicad-10-to-11-migration.md).

## VS Code Canary

`.github/workflows/vscode-canary.yml` launches a focused extension host smoke
suite every week and on manual dispatch against the VS Code lanes from
`compatibility.yaml`: current stable, the minimum `engines.vscode` host, and
insiders. The smoke suite covers activation, commands, context-gated views,
custom editor/webview bootstrap, diagnostics lifecycle access, and project/MCP
view registration. Unit smokes keep the mock MCP Tools and provider paths in
the same lane. The stable and minimum lanes fail the workflow; the insiders
lane keeps reporting prerelease breakage without blocking stable support.

Each lane uploads the Extension Development Host logs and available test
artifacts. A failing lane opens or updates a compatibility issue. Stable-lane
failures add the `release-blocker` label because the release gate lists VS Code
stable compatibility as required.

## KiCad GUI Smoke

Real KiCad GUI IPC smoke coverage now runs from
[KiCad MCP Pro](https://oaslananka.github.io/kicad-mcp-pro/). This repository
keeps `check:kicad-gui-smoke` as a lightweight policy check for extension-side
GUI smoke wiring and documentation.

## Regression Coverage Map

Every bug fix should add an automated regression when practical. If automation
is not practical, the PR must explain why and include the manual smoke command
or artifact.

## KiCad Fixture Corpus

The canonical fixture package for OASLANA-53 lives at
`packages/kicad-fixtures/` and is documented in
[`docs/kicad-fixture-corpus.md`](kicad-fixture-corpus.md).

Use semantic fixture IDs from `manifest.json` rather than hard-coded directory
walks in tests. Regenerate fixtures only through the explicit generator:

```bash
corepack pnpm run fixtures:kicad:generate
```

The fixture gate is deterministic and does not invoke KiCad, VS Code, or MCP
servers implicitly:

```bash
corepack pnpm run test:fixtures
```

## VS Code Integration and E2E Test Matrix

This matrix records how the extension is validated inside the VS Code Extension
Host across operating systems, VS Code versions, KiCad lines, Workspace Trust
states, workspace shapes, and representative workflows. The reduced matrix runs
on every pull request; the full matrix adds scheduled and canary lanes. A
reduced PR matrix plus a full scheduled matrix is an intentional cost/coverage
trade-off, not missing coverage.

### Matrix dimensions

| Dimension | Reduced matrix (every PR) | Full matrix (scheduled / canary) | Source of truth |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Operating system | `ubuntu-24.04`, `windows-2025`, `macos-15` | Same three runners | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` `vscode-extension` job matrix |
| VS Code version | Pinned `DEFAULT_VSCODE_TEST_VERSION` | `engines.vscode` floor and Insiders canary | `apps/vscode-extension/test/vscodeTestRuntime.ts`, `.github/workflows/vscode-canary.yml` |
| KiCad line | Deterministic fixtures and mocked CLI probes (no `kicad-cli` required) | Real `kicad-cli` line from the canary host | `compatibility.yaml`, `.github/workflows/cross-repo-compatibility.yml`, KiCad MCP Pro |
| Workspace Trust | Restricted and trusted contracts | Same | `apps/vscode-extension/test/integration/extension.test.ts` |
| Workspace shape | Single-root and multi-root | Same | `extension.test.ts` (single-root), `apps/vscode-extension/test/unit/multiProjectWorkspace.test.ts` (multi-root) |

### Workflow coverage

| Workflow | Covering test | Layer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Activation when a `.kicad_pro` workspace opens | `extension.test.ts` — _activates when .kicad_pro workspace opened_ | Extension Host integration |
| Core command registration smoke after activation | `extension.test.ts` — _registers every package.json command at runtime_ | Extension Host integration |
| Command enablement and context keys | `extension.test.ts` — _gates command palette commands by file state and Workspace Trust_ | Extension Host integration |
| Workspace Trust restricted and trusted behavior | `extension.test.ts` — _declares activation, empty-workspace welcome, and Workspace Trust contracts_ | Extension Host integration |
| KiCad CLI discovery with valid, missing, and invalid paths | `apps/vscode-extension/test/unit/kicadCliDetector.test.ts` | Unit |
| Project discovery — single-root | `extension.test.ts` — _renders project tree fixture files_ | Extension Host integration |
| Project discovery — multi-root | `multiProjectWorkspace.test.ts` — _aggregates KiCad projects discovered across multiple workspace roots_ | Unit |
| Viewer / webview activation smoke | `apps/vscode-extension/test/e2e/viewer.test.ts`; `extension.test.ts` registers custom editors | E2E / integration |
| Diagnostics update and stale-clear behavior | `extension.test.ts` — _scopes Problems diagnostics to exact URIs and clears stale diagnostics after a clean save_ | Extension Host integration |
| Real MCP pair quickstart, quality gate, and context-bridge flows | `apps/vscode-extension/test/integration/realServer/*.flow.test.ts` | Integration |

### Reduced versus full matrix

- **Reduced (every PR):** all three operating systems, the pinned VS Code
  version, and deterministic KiCad fixtures with mocked CLI probes. This is the
  release-blocking lane.
- **Full (scheduled / nightly / canary):** adds the VS Code Insiders lane
  (`vscode-canary.yml`), the real `kicad-cli` cross-repo compatibility canary,
  and the real-pair host run. Multi-KiCad-line installation is not required on
  every PR job; the reduced matrix uses fixtures and probes instead.

Multi-root coverage exercises the shipped
[`multi-root-workspace`](kicad-fixture-corpus.md#fixture-coverage) corpus shape:
two KiCad projects and a `.code-workspace` file across separate folders.

## CI Ownership

CI ownership follows product boundaries:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` owns path-filtered fast PR lanes for metadata,
  extension, shared packages, integration contracts, extension performance
  budgets, and forbidden reference checks.
- `.github/workflows/security.yml`, `.github/workflows/gitleaks.yml`, and
  `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` own security and static analysis lanes.
- `.github/workflows/vscode-canary.yml` owns scheduled/manual VS Code
  compatibility lanes sourced from `compatibility.yaml`.
- `.github/workflows/cross-repo-compatibility.yml` owns published
  `kicad-mcp` artifact compatibility checks for this repo.
- KiCad MCP Pro owns real KiCad CLI, GUI IPC, and MCP transport
  canaries.
- Product-specific validation remains inside each product package so the root
  workflow can compose it without direct source imports between products.

## Source Verification

This strategy was checked against current primary sources:

- VS Code extension testing docs for Extension Development Host and
  `@vscode/test-electron`.
- VS Code webview UX guidance for constrained webview usage and native UI
  preference.
- W3C WCAG 2.1 Recommendation for Level AA success criteria and conformance
  model.
- Deque axe-core documentation for WCAG 2.1 A/AA rule tags and browser-based
  accessibility automation.
- Playwright visual comparison docs for `toHaveScreenshot`, snapshot naming,
  and snapshot update flow.
- KiCad 10 command-line documentation for `kicad-cli` driven ERC, DRC, export,
  and version checks.
- KiCad PCB Editor documentation for action-plugin/GUI scripting boundaries and
  KiCad IPC API developer documentation for live-editor automation scope.
- KiCad Windows Downloads for supported Windows versions and current stable
  10.0.3 installer availability.
