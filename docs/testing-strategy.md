# Testing Strategy

OASLANA-35 / GitHub issue #36 defines the maximum automated test strategy for
KiCad Studio Kit. The goal is to make normal development depend on repeatable
local and CI gates instead of manual VS Code or KiCad inspection after every
change.

This document is the canonical repository-level testing guide. Product-specific
notes can add detail, but they should not weaken these gates.

## Gate Summary

| Gate                 | Trigger                                                              | Purpose                                                                                         | Required command                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Fast PR gate         | Every pull request                                                   | Catch formatting, lint, type, unit, package, metadata, boundary, and compatibility regressions. | `corepack pnpm run check`                     |
| Product gate         | Product-scoped changes                                               | Prove the touched product still builds, tests, and packages independently.                      | Product commands below                        |
| Contract gate        | Protocol, compatibility, or cross-product changes                    | Prove extension and MCP assumptions remain aligned.                                             | `corepack pnpm run test:contract`             |
| Fixture gate         | Parser, diagnostics, command-builder, or KiCad file behavior changes | Prove deterministic KiCad corpus behavior stays stable.                                         | `corepack pnpm run test:fixtures`             |
| Nightly quality gate | Scheduled and manual workflow                                        | Re-run the repository gate plus contract and fixture gates outside the fast PR path.            | `.github/workflows/nightly-quality-gates.yml` |
| Manual smoke         | Release candidate only                                               | Final human inspection where automation is not practical.                                       | PR notes must name the exact manual check     |

## Fast PR Gates

Fast gates must be deterministic and must not depend on a manually opened KiCad
or VS Code desktop session.

Run the complete repository gate before opening or updating a PR that touches
root tooling, CI, shared compatibility, release policy, or docs:

```bash
corepack enable
corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
uv sync --all-extras --frozen --project packages/mcp-server
corepack pnpm run check
```

Extension-only changes use:

```bash
corepack pnpm run check:kicad-studio
corepack pnpm run test:kicad-studio
corepack pnpm run build:kicad-studio
corepack pnpm run package:kicad-studio
```

MCP server changes use:

```bash
uv sync --all-extras --frozen --project packages/mcp-server
corepack pnpm run check:kicad-mcp-pro
corepack pnpm run test:kicad-mcp-pro
corepack pnpm run build:kicad-mcp-pro
corepack pnpm run package:kicad-mcp-pro
```

npm wrapper changes use:

```bash
corepack pnpm run check:mcp-npm
```

Protocol, compatibility, or cross-product changes use:

```bash
corepack pnpm run test:contract
corepack pnpm run test:fixtures
```

## Nightly Quality Gates

The nightly gate catches slow and environment-sensitive regressions without
making every PR wait for the heaviest checks. It must stay non-release: no tags,
no publishing, no marketplace uploads, and no artifact promotion.

The scheduled workflow is `.github/workflows/nightly-quality-gates.yml`. It
runs on `workflow_dispatch` and a daily cron schedule. The workflow currently
executes:

```bash
corepack pnpm run check
corepack pnpm run test:contract
corepack pnpm run test:fixtures
```

As the M1-M4 roadmap lands, extend this workflow in focused PRs:

| Future gate                | Tracking issue | Required behavior                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Shared fixture corpus      | OASLANA-36     | Replace placeholder fixture coverage with a shared deterministic KiCad corpus and golden expected outputs.                     |
| Unit test expansion        | OASLANA-37     | Cover project discovery, command builders, diagnostics, state machines, and MCP client behavior.                               |
| MCP protocol contracts     | OASLANA-43     | Cover Streamable HTTP, session headers, stateless mode, tool discovery, errors, timeouts, and ChatGPT connector compatibility. |
| MCP adapter layer tests    | OASLANA-56     | Verify extension UI and commands use the adapter boundary instead of direct MCP calls.                                         |
| Server-info contract tests | OASLANA-57     | Verify advertised server-info, capability metadata, and compatibility ranges.                                                  |
| Real-pair E2E              | OASLANA-75     | Build both products, start the server, launch the extension host, connect them, and validate capability handshakes.            |
| VS Code canary             | OASLANA-81     | Run current stable, insiders, and minimum supported VS Code versions.                                                          |
| KiCad canary               | OASLANA-82     | Run primary, supported, deprecated, and prerelease KiCad CLI lanes where practical.                                            |

## Regression Coverage Map

Every bug fix should add an automated regression when practical. If automation
is not practical, the PR must explain why and include the manual smoke command
or artifact.

| Issue      | Risk covered                                                                    | Required test layer                                                        |

| OASLANA-36 | KiCad file parser or quality-gate regressions that lack deterministic fixtures. | Shared KiCad fixture corpus and golden expected outputs                    |
| OASLANA-37 | Extension helpers regressing without unit coverage.                             | Jest unit suites under `apps/vscode-extension/test/unit/`                  |
| OASLANA-43 | MCP transport/session compatibility regressions.                                | MCP contract tests for Streamable HTTP and `MCP-Protocol-Version` behavior |
| OASLANA-56 | Extension code bypassing the MCP adapter boundary.                              | Adapter unit tests plus integration tests for UI and command calls         |
| OASLANA-57 | MCP server-info or capability metadata drift.                                   | Server-info and compatibility contract tests                               |
| OASLANA-75 | Extension and MCP server passing independently but failing as a pair.           | Real-pair E2E tests                                                        |

| OASLANA-63 | Ownership or branch protection drift.                                           | CODEOWNERS/policy validation and PR checklist checks                       |
| OASLANA-64 | Supply-chain regressions in both products and artifacts.                        | Security workflow, package validation, audit, and provenance checks        |

## Local Commands

Use the narrowest command first while developing, then run the broader gate
before pushing.

## CI Ownership

CI ownership follows product boundaries:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` owns fast PR lanes for metadata, extension, MCP
  server, npm wrapper, and forbidden reference checks.
- `.github/workflows/security.yml`, `.github/workflows/gitleaks.yml`, and
  `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` own security and static analysis lanes.
- `.github/workflows/nightly-quality-gates.yml` owns the non-release scheduled
  quality gate.
- Product-specific validation remains inside each product package so the root
  workflow can compose it without direct source imports between products.

## Source Verification

This strategy was checked against current primary sources:

- VS Code extension testing docs for Extension Development Host and
  `@vscode/test-electron`.
- VS Code webview UX guidance for constrained webview usage and native UI
  preference.
- Playwright visual comparison docs for `toHaveScreenshot`, snapshot naming,
  and snapshot update flow.
- KiCad 10 command-line documentation for `kicad-cli` driven ERC, DRC, export,
  and version checks.
- Model Context Protocol 2025-06-18 transport docs for Streamable HTTP,
