## Local Validation

Run the root checks before opening a pull request:

```bash
corepack pnpm run check:forbidden-refs
corepack pnpm run check:boundaries
corepack pnpm run check:version
corepack pnpm run check:compatibility
corepack pnpm run check:runtime-policy
```

Product-scoped checks:

```bash
corepack pnpm run check:kicad-studio
corepack pnpm run check:kicad-mcp-pro
corepack pnpm run check:mcp-npm
corepack pnpm run test:contract
```

## Issue Order

Work follows the governance phases documented in
[governance board model](architecture/governance-board.md).

## Ownership

Ownership and branch protection are documented in
[branch protection](architecture/branch-protection.md) and the repository
`CODEOWNERS` file.

## Regression Coverage

Bug fixes should include automated regression coverage when practical. Use unit tests,
integration tests, fixture checks, contract tests, or visual/accessibility checks based on the
changed surface.

## Accessibility Coverage

New or changed KiCad Studio UI must keep the accessibility gate current before a
pull request is ready for review:

```bash
corepack pnpm --filter kicadstudio run test:a11y
```

Update `apps/vscode-extension/test/a11y/accessibilityConformance.test.ts` when a
change adds or materially changes a webview, custom editor toolbar, side panel,
BOM/Netlist/Component Search surface, MCP Tools tree, Quality Gates tree, AI Fix
Queue tree, status bar item, dialog-like flow, search box, or overlay.

Contributor requirements:

- Keep keyboard order deterministic and free of focus traps.
- Provide accessible names for icon-only, symbolic, status, and toolbar actions.
- Give disabled buttons reason text with `aria-describedby`, title text, or
  adjacent assistive text when the reason is knowable.
- Use VS Code theme tokens and verify dark, light, and high-contrast behavior.
- Include `:focus-visible` styling for production webview controls.
- Include `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` CSS when a surface uses animation or
  transitions.

See [accessibility conformance target](accessibility.md) for the full policy.

Runtime support changes must follow the [support matrix](support-matrix.md).
